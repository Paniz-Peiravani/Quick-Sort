# Quick Sort in MIPS Assembly

This MIPS assembly code, developed in MARS IDE, implements the quick sort algorithm to sort an array of eight even integers. The program follows these steps:

1. Initializes an array of eight even integers.
2. Calls the `quicksort` function to sort the array.
3. Displays the sorted array.

## Code Explanation

- The program initializes an array of eight even integers.
- It uses the quick sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order.
- The `partition` function is used to find the pivot and divide the array.
- The `swap` function swaps elements in the array as needed during the sorting process.
- The sorted array is displayed using system calls.
